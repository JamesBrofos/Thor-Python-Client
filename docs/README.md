# Thor Python Client

This website contains the Thor Python Client, which is a client-side interface for Thor Server written in R. The Thor Server and Thor Python Client together provide a light-weight and powerful architecture for Bayesian optimization of machine learning systems.

The Thor Python Client, like the rest of the Thor suite of Bayesian optimization tools, is provided under the MIT license.

The Thor Python Client is developed and maintained by James Brofos. If you have feedback for James, please contact him at <james@brofos.org>.
